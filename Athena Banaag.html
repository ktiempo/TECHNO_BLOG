							<h1>Overcoming Flooding Obstacles on Her Journey to School by Car</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="Athena Banaag.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<p>As we sit down with <b>Athena Banaag</b>, a 3rd year Environmental Science student at University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines - CDO campus (USTP-CDO), She opens up about balancing academic life with the challenges of commuting to school. Living in Camaman-an, Cagayan de Oro City, a flood-prone zone, Athena, frequently navigates difficult conditions, especially during the rainy season. In this conversation, she shares how the constant threat of flooding impacts her daily commute, studies, and overall well-being, and how real-time flood updates could offer much-needed relief.</p>
							<p>Athena frequently encounters flooding during the rainy season, with warnings often coming too late for effective planning. Real-time flood information is crucial for her to avoid dangerous areas and reduce commute stress. Floods significantly disrupt her daily life, doubling travel times and complicating access to essential services. The financial and emotional costs are high, with increased fuel expenses, vehicle wear, and constant anxiety. She has been stranded before, facing vehicle damage and safety concerns. A reliable flood detection system would greatly alleviate these issues by providing timely alerts and safe route options, allowing her to plan trips more confidently, minimize delays, and reduce stress during storms.</p>
							<p>The challenges faced by athena commuting in flood-prone areas underscore the urgent need for effective flood management solutions. Inconsistent and late flood warnings often lead to risky travel decisions and increased stress. Access to real-time flood information would significantly enhance safety and efficiency by enabling timely and informed decisions. The impact of flooding extends beyond delays, affecting fuel costs, vehicle maintenance, and overall well-being. Implementing a reliable flood detection system could mitigate these issues by providing accurate alerts and safe route options. Ultimately, such a system would not only reduce the risk of vehicle damage and the likelihood of being stranded but also offer athena greater peace of mind and a more manageable commuting experience.</p>
