							<h1>Understanding Market Sizing: A Reflection and Its Importance for Farm to Plate</h1>
							<p><i>By: Krysel April Tiempo</i></p>
							<p><i>Date: 05/12/24</i></p>
							
							<p>In the journey of building a startup, understanding the competitive landscape is not just a step—it’s a critical foundation for success. For our startup, Farm to Plate, which connects local farmers with consumers through an e-commerce platform for fresh, sustainable agricultural goods, competitive analysis serves as a mirror. It reflects where we stand, what we’re up against, and the unique value we can bring to the table.</p>
                            <p>Market sizing is a critical step in the journey of any startup. It allows entrepreneurs to quantify the potential size of their target market, understand its value, and determine whether their business idea is viable. For us at Farm to Plate, a startup connecting local farmers to city consumers, market sizing has been more than just a numbers exercise—it’s been a way to validate our mission and refine our vision.</p>
                            <p>Market sizing is essentially the process of estimating the total revenue or customer potential for a product or service within a defined market. It answers essential questions like how many people need what you’re offering, how much they are willing to spend, and what portion of the market you can realistically capture. By understanding these elements, businesses can set realistic goals, make informed decisions, and communicate their value to investors effectively.</p>
                            <p>For Farm to Plate, market sizing wasn’t just about identifying how many farmers and consumers might use our platform. It was about understanding the broader agricultural supply chain and the challenges both farmers and consumers face. Through this process, we uncovered key insights. First, we validated the demand—there’s a significant appetite for fresh, locally-sourced produce in urban areas, where consumers value convenience, transparency, and affordability. At the same time, farmers in our region need better access to markets and fair pricing.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, market sizing gave us a clearer focus. Instead of attempting to cater to everyone, we concentrated on addressing the most pressing needs—providing fresh, affordable produce to consumers and ensuring fair income opportunities for farmers. Lastly, presenting a clear and realistic market sizing helped us appeal to potential investors. With solid data, we demonstrated that Farm to Plate isn’t just a business; it’s a solution to inefficiencies in the agricultural supply chain.</p>
                            <p>In our case, market sizing required breaking down two major groups. On the supply side, we looked at the number of farmers in our region who would be interested in selling their produce online, their production capacity, and their sales frequency. On the demand side, we analyzed how many urban residents are willing to order fresh produce online, their spending patterns, and their grocery budgets. From this analysis, we estimated the Total Addressable Market (TAM), the Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), and finally, the Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)—our projected market share in the first few years.</p>
                            <p>Market sizing has shaped our startup’s direction in many ways. It influenced our pricing strategy, helping us design affordable subscription options like PlatePro to generate revenue while remaining accessible. It also guided our marketing efforts by highlighting high-demand urban areas where campaigns could have the most impact. Lastly, it provided insights for scalability, enabling us to plan for future expansion in regions with similar market dynamics.</p>
                            <p>Reflecting on this journey, it’s clear that market sizing is more than just a tool—it’s a mindset. For Farm to Plate, it has helped us bridge the gap between local farmers and urban consumers while ensuring our solution is practical and sustainable. Market sizing isn’t just about numbers; it’s the foundation for building something meaningful. It has strengthened our commitment to making fresh, affordable produce accessible, supporting farmers, and fostering stronger community connections.</p>
                            <p>By grounding our vision in data and insights, we’ve turned our passion into a viable business model, proving that understanding your market is the first step toward building a successful and impactful startup.</p>
